# RTSProject
A simple RTS game (which became closer to a tower defense game) developed in completion of the Game Development course in the University of the East

The player must protect Merlin's tower by building structures to defend the tower. The player can build barracks, protection fields, and lamps to help defend the tower. In order to build these buildings, the players must collect coins from Merlin's tower. The player can also upgrade buildings to make them more efficient.

This project uses free assets from the Unity asset store for the models and animations of the soldiers and the orcs.

## Controls
Right-click -> Move
Q -> Upgrade/Build
E -> Collect

## Unity Version
2021.3.26f1

## Known Issues
1. Instances where upgrading barracks can lead to negative coins on hand
2. Instances where the enemy spawning system may become inconsistent with the wave status
3. Instances where "Q" and "E" buttons only become responsive after multiple presses
